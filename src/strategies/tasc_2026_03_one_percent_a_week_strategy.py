    TASC 2026.03 — One Percent A Week
    Original article: "Trading Snapbacks In A Leveraged ETF" by Dion Kurczek (March 2026).

    Logic:
      1. Record the Monday open as the weekly reference price (wOpen).
      2. Enter LONG when price dips to 1% below wOpen (limit fill: low <= wOpen * 0.99).
      3. Profit target (+1%) and break-even risk management are handled by the RL engine.
      4. Hard close on Friday — return FLAT regardless of position.

    strategy.exit(), strategy.position_size, and strategy.position_avg_price are all
    ignored — the execution engine manages those externally.
